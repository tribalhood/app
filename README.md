# Tribal Hood

Project based off of the concept of "internal economies".

This is an MVP that requires Internet access and a Google account, to use Google Sheets as a Database. Ideally this would be self-hosted and require no externally-owned accounts.

The [base spreadsheet you can copy and use for your own community is here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ev0YblqAwWxph6bULRVjzaoZTmr6GXEoX9Vbc-kZAbE/edit#gid=1367513840). Copy that into a spreadsheet for your community (you need write access).

Go to https://tribalhood.github.io/app, authenticate, paste your community spreadsheet's URL, and you're good to go.

## Development

Just run a local web server, like: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`.


## To-dos:

- [ ] Validate spreadsheet "Valid if 0" formula
